I’m **Li-Sheng Zhuang (莊立勝)**, a second-year master’s student at the [**Institute of Statistics and Data Science**](https://stat.site.nthu.edu.tw/?Lang=zh-tw), **National Tsing Hua University**, Taiwan. I hold a bachelor’s degree in [**Applied Mathematics**](https://www.amath.nchu.edu.tw/) with a double major in **Finance** from **National Chung Hsing University**.

My expertise lies in **biostatistics**, with a particular focus on **survival analysis**, **causal inference**, and the **illness-death model**.
