# About Me

Hello! I'm **Li-Sheng Zhuang (莊立勝)**, currently a graduate student in the Institute of Statistics and Data Science at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), Taiwan.

My academic interests lie primarily in **causal inference**, **survival analysis**, and **semi-competing risks models**, particularly focusing on **causal mediation analysis** in illness-death processes. I am currently completing my master’s thesis on this topic and have also engaged in research involving non-Markovian structures and bootstrap methods.

Prior to my graduate studies, I earned my B.S. in **Applied Mathematics** with a double major in **Finance** from National Chung Hsing University (NCHU). My undergraduate work involved applying machine learning to predict customer loyalty and designing algorithmic trading bots for futures and options.

I have received multiple honors for both academic performance and teaching, including:
- **Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award** in Calculus at NCHU (Fall 2021 & Spring 2022),
- **Award of Excellence** at the 7th Graduate Student Symposium on Statistical Research (NTHU),
- **Membership in the Phi Tau Phi Scholastic Honor Society**.

I am passionate about applying rigorous statistical thinking to real-world problems, and my long-term goal is to contribute to both research and teaching in the field of statistics.
