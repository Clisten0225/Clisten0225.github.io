# About Me

Hello! I’m **Li-Sheng Zhuang (莊立勝)**, a second-year master’s student at the **Institute of Statistics and Data Science**, **National Tsing Hua University (NTHU)**, Taiwan. I hold a bachelor’s degree in **Applied Mathematics** with a double major in **Finance** from **National Chung Hsing University (NCHU)**.

My expertise lies in **biostatistics**, with a particular focus on **survival analysis**, **causal inference**, and the **illness-death model**. I am also interested in applications of **machine learning** in finance and healthcare. My current master’s thesis investigates **causal mediation analysis** within the illness-death framework, integrating non-Markov structures and nonparametric estimation methods.

## Project Experience

1. **Causal Mediation Analysis in Illness-Death Models**  
   Developed and applied causal mediation methodology to illness-death models in survival analysis. This work forms the basis of my master’s thesis and involves non-Markov structures, and comparison with existing methods.

2. **Futures and Options Pair Trading Bot**  
   Built a pair trading algorithm for futures and options using statistical arbitrage strategies. This project was presented in a student competition hosted by the Taiwan Futures Exchange.

3. **Credit Card Customer Loyalty Prediction**  
   Implemented machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) to predict customer loyalty using transaction and demographic data. This was the final project for a graduate-level course in statistical learning.

## Programming Languages

I am proficient in **R**, **Python**, and **Matlab**, and have hands-on experience using these tools for data analysis, model development, and statistical computing.
