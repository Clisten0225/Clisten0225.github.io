# About Me

Hello! I’m **Li-Sheng Zhuang (莊立勝)**, currently a **Research Assistant** at the [**Institute of Statistical Science (ISS), Academia Sinica**](https://www.stat.sinica.edu.tw/), working in [**Prof. Yen-Tsung Huang**](https://www.stat.sinica.edu.tw/cht/index.php?act=researcher_manager&code=view&member=13)’s research group. I received my M.S. in **Statistics and Data Science** from [**National Tsing Hua University**](https://stat.site.nthu.edu.tw/?Lang=zh-tw) and hold a bachelor’s degree in [**Applied Mathematics**](https://www.amath.nchu.edu.tw/) with a double major in **Finance** from **National Chung Hsing University**.

My current work focuses on mediation analysis, with an emphasis on machine learning and nonparametric regression methods. From a methodological perspective, I am particularly interested in **nonparametric approaches**. Previously, my master’s thesis investigated causal mediation analysis under a non-Markov illness–death model, incorporating kernel density estimation method.
